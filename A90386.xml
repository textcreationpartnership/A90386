            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>O how pleaſant and profitable might a new kind of Warre be
(after this bitter old-faſhioned one) between Parliament
and People, if each would conteſt by ſtratagems of love
tenderneſſe, ſweetneſſe, and righteouſneſſe, to conquer the
hearts of each other, wherein both their ſtrengths lie, more
then in any outward viſible force or power, that either can
lay hold on.</p>

PARLIAMENT</head>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Iſerable muſt the ſtate of this Creation needs be,
while calamities are daily growing on every
part of it, and the remedies deſired and ſought
for, to redreſſe them, are ſo far from true and
ſound curing, that they alſo come to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
among the number of calamities.</p>
            <p>This Nation was very ſick; a Parliament much deſired to
cure it, many hopes and expectations faſtened upon their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
but now moſt men are grown ſick both of the Phiſitian
and the cure.</p>
            <p>How farre there is juſt occaſion hereof given concerns you
neerly to conſider, who are not to mind your own wills or ends,
but the deſires and welfares of thoſe who have entruſted you:
How farre there is unjuſt offence taken, behoves them throughly
to ſcan who are ſevere Judges of your actions, leſt they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
prove guilty of that towards you which they charge you
with, and obſtruct you in the proſecution of that, which if once
effected, might be both for their owne and others good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:118248:3"/>
It is no delight to me to open my mouth againſt any much
leſſe againſt thoſe who ſhould deſerve, and have honour. I could
pleaſe my ſelfe rather in apologizing for; then in accuſing, though
generally I find the ſtate of man to be ſuch, that much may be
ſaid againſt him little for him.</p>
            <p>But I may not uſe many words; There are only two conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
I would at preſent propoſe to your view, the one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is of ſomewhat a large nature the other referres to your late e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
Government.</p>
            <p>That which referres to your Government is this.</p>
            <p>Yee have made a change in the forme of Government, putting
a new image and ſuperſcription upon it, which is like to be of
great concernment one way or other, but which way it will be,
is yet ſomewhat doubtfull; and it may not be unworthy of you,
to bethink your ſelves, what ſecurity ye can give the people (who
cannot but deſire it) that this new mold of Government ſhall not
be found as burdenſome and oppreſſive to them as the foregoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was complained to be.</p>
            <p>If ye can demonſtrate that it is more capable of bounds, and
that yee alſo are more carefull to provide due bounds for it, this
may yeeld ſome ſatisfaction to that reaſon which makes the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry:
But if ye lay the ſtreſſe upon the goodneſſe of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ye employ, this may neither prove ſo ſatisfactory at preſent,
nor ſo ſafe for the future, as ſome perhaps expect it ſhould and
will.</p>
            <p>The other relates to afear which hath laine long upon my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
concerning ſome things which to my obſervation ſeemed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to eat out the benefit of this preſent Parliament, and to ſwallow
up its credit with the people.</p>
            <p>The things I have been jealous of in this reſpect are chiefly
theſe three.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Multitude of affairs, Prolixity in your motions, and want
of an orderly Government of your owne body,</hi> which may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
both the former: want of a right rule to ſquare and order
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118248:3"/>
your ſelves in your proceedings may eaſily draw many things
upon you which might be better managed by other hands, and
may likewiſe retard your diſpatch in what yee ſet about.</p>
            <p>Yee have fallen into that calamity which <hi>Iethro</hi> forewarned
<hi>Moſes</hi> of, namely of tiring out both your ſelves and the People:
ye complaine of your work, and they ſtill complaine of their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens:
your work ſtill growes upon you and their burdens ſtill lie
upon them: the coſt, the attendance the ſeeking, the waiting for
releife will eat out the ſweetneſſe of it, if it ſhould come at laſt.
How can the People be pleaſed, while things are thus? How can
ye be pleaſed with your ſelves while yee act thus? How can it
but peirce your Eares and hearts to heare Perſons groane and
complaine under thoſe afflictions, which your conſciences cannot
but tell you, yee ought to eaſe them of?</p>
            <p>Give me leave to ſpeak plainly, I cannot but think that if yee
had been in a right way, your work had beene done long before
now; but in the way ye have been in, and (as farre as I can ſee) yet
are in, there appeares no likely-hood of a deſired end.</p>
            <p>How long will it be ere yee can come to particular buſineſſes?
how long muſt yee needs be in diſpatching them? And how faſt
will both they, and more publique buſineſſe grow upon
you?</p>
            <p>I leave theſe things to your conſideration, longing to ſee the
time that the people may have juſt cauſe to be ſatisfied with
your tranſactions, and that they may be ſatisfied with that
cauſe.</p>
            <p>This is the preſent (though faint) deſire of him who would
rejoyce to ſerve you or his Countrey in ſuch a way, as he might
be free from any ſnare or temptation to ſerve himſelfe.</p>

whether juſtly or unjuſtly uttered: joy, peace, reſt, content
within in euery ſpirit, and good will towards all abroad,
would make the proſpect of affaires ſomewhat more pleaſant
to me, then as yet it is.</p>
            <p>We are now entangled in miſerie: after all our running
from it we are become involved in it. We can neither endure
our ſickneſſe nor our cure. We are ſo divided into parties,
that the whole is only liable to ruine, but cannot be ſaved.
one ſort cannot be pleaſed unleſs an other be cruſhed. Our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
hopes, endeavours ends, are various and contrary, and ſo
are our welfares; ſo that which way ſo ever you turne the
ſcale a conſiderable part ſinkes, groanes, and complaines of
oppreſſion &amp; hardſhip which it ſuffers by the eaſe and exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of other parts [What is there no common good wherein

both that variety and contrariety that is amongſt us,
might be better ordered: true wiſdome could ſo diſpoſe of it,
as it ſhould no longer thus harſhly jarre, but make up a ſweet
harmony.</p>
            <p>But this is the great unrighteouſneſſe in man, he thinks
himſelfe can never be dealt gently enough with but he would
have force uſed towards others; he may be led by reaſon, but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118248:4"/>
others that diſſent from his reaſon, are obſtinate, and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
requires the uſe of compulſion towards ſuch: and oh how
juſt is it, that every man, in his turne and ſeaſon, ſhould meet
with that force, with that oppreſſion, which he in his deſire
reaſon, and judgement, hath meaſured out to others?</p>
            <p>Thou complaineſt of unrighteouſneſſe abroad, but how
little doſt thou think of that root of unrighteouſneſſe that is
in thy ſelf which if it had the ſame dunging &amp; watering in
thee, as it hath in others would ſoon be as fertile if not more,
yea doth already beare too much fruit in thee?</p>
            <p>Tell me truly, Art not thou unrighteous in judging o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for unrighteouſneſſe? art not thou unwilling to give
them their due allowances, to heare what might be ſpoken in
their juſt defence? doſt thou not deale thus with the preſent
powers? wouldſt thou be content to be dealt ſo with, if thou
wert in their ſtead? Art not thou too forward to accuſe, to
proſecute, to condemn, but to backward to entertaine what
may be ſpoken by way of juſtification or excuſe? Thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
expecteſt to ſee the judgement of God overtake them
for their unrighteouſneſſe, and doſt thou think to eſcape
judgement thy ſelf, who judgeſt them ſo unrighteouſly? How
canſt thou expect God ſhould make them juſt towards thee
in their actings when thou art ſo unjuſt towards them in
thy interpretation of their actings?</p>
            <p>Oh how vaine is man become, ſowing the ſeeds of miſery
to himſelfe and others, and yet complaining if hee miſſe
of happineſſe: every man deſires happineſſe, and thinks the
way he walks in leads to it, and wonders if he meet not with
it ſo ſoon as his expectations perſwade him he ſhall, &amp; is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to blame others for the protraction or diverſion of that
good he expected: but little do's man think when he reaps
miſery, that it was wrapt up and lay hid in that ſeed which
he himſelfe did ſow! what will be the iſſue of theſe things?</p>
            <p>Me thinks I ſee man undermining himſelfe, and a power

            <p>I Suppoſe it cannot be unknown to any, who have taken the
leaſt notice of the late tranſactions in this ſhattered Nation,
what a ſharp and bitter conflict there hath been in the bowells
of it, for the recovery of thoſe rights and liberties, which were
bleeding to death, and had almoſt given up the Ghoſt. And it
concerns every one; after all this coſt and travaile, through ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſtormes and tempeſts, to contribute his utmoſt vigilance and
induſtry, for bringing the ſhip with its burden into a ſafe Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
that every one may at length be fully poſſeſſ'd of that,
which he hath run through ſo many hazards and difficulties to
attaine. This lies much upon all, though moſt upon thoſe
who have moſt power and advantages in their hands to effect
it. That which will accompliſh all, is a righteous adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Government; whereby our rights and priviledges are both
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118248:6"/>
preſerved and increaſed, where need is; and whatſoever any man
in reaſon can deſire, this will ſupply him with.</p>
            <p>For the effecting of this, theſe three things are requiſite. <hi>Good
Lawes, proper hands</hi> duly to execute them, and an <hi>exact Rule</hi>
or <hi>way,</hi> whereby thoſe hands may be guided unto a due and
ſpeedy execution of thoſe Lawes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lawes</hi> are the proper bounds of right and liberty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
every man is determined what he ſhall enjoy for his owne
particular, and what he ſhall be engaged to act for the publick
welfare. Theſe muſt be certaine and ſuited to the ſtate of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
elſe there is a foundation of injuſtice, ſlavery, and miſery
laid at the bottome of all, which it will be very hard to build
righteouſneſſe and liberty upon. And theſe Lawes ſhould be
cleare and eaſy to be known, elſe any man may eaſily be prone to
run into dangers unawares, or to miſſe of that remedy which is
by the Law provided for him, in caſe of injury done him: for want
of this, Lawes may eaſily become ſnares to them whom they
ſhould preſerve from being inſnared, and advantages to the crafty
to perplex and cruſh the more ſimple and plaine-hearted, whom
they ſhould be a fence to, againſt the crafty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Execution</hi> is the life of the Law. It is not the Law barely
that affrights or encourages, but the execution of it: and our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and complaint hath been more concerning the Non-execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Lawes we had, then of the Non-addition of the Lawes
we wanted.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſo ſoon as we are fitted with lawes, it is in the next
place to be throughly weighed what hands are moſt fit and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for the due and faithfull execution of theſe lawes, without
which, the framing of the beſt lawes that can be imagined, is to
little purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Now that which will make the execution moſt certaine, is a
cleere <hi>Rule</hi> preſcribed to them who are to execute, whereby
they may be rightly guided in the adminiſtration, and left, as
little as may be, to determine or order things according to their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118248:6"/>
owne preſent apprehenſions and judgements, leſt at that back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,
arbitrary Government (which is the foundation of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny)
on a ſudden creep in.</p>
            <p>This would be carefully look'd to at the beginning, while
things are in conſtitution, and may more eaſily be molded, then
afie: things are ſetled. For how can it be expected, but man who
hath the ſame corruption in him with others to draw him aſide,
temptations above others unto it, and advantages of ſecurity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
others (as authority, power and greatneſſe do alwayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford)
I ſay how can it be expected, but man in this ſtate ſhould
ſtep out of the way, unleſſe he have firme and fixed bounds to
keep him in his proper compaſſe. Surely the people are bound,
in reſpect to their own ſafty, and the good of thoſe they employ
in ſo great a matter as government is, not only to provide good
lawes for themſelves to be governed by but alſo due bounds for
them to keepe within, who are to act in the execution of the
Lawes.</p>
            <p>And it may be worthy the conſideration, whether the late King
were ſufficiently furniſhed in this reſpect and if he were left too
much to his owne liberty, and thereby ſomewhat occaſioned to
miſcarry, what may free us from this danger for the future.</p>
            <p>There is no ſuch great matter in the change of Government,
as many conceive (who peirce not into the true cauſes of things,
but are ready to fly out upon that which ſtands moſt in their
eye) every Government having its advantage as well as its diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;
but the goodneſſe and ſafety of every government lyes
in that well ordering and well bounding of it for ſpeedy and due
adminiſtration of the Lawes.</p>
            <p>And upon this ground it ſeemeth to me improper for Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to intermeddle with matters of Government, further then
to ſettle it in fit hands, and within juſt bounds: becauſe they are
entruſted with an arbitrary power, which is abſolutely neceſſary
to the work whereunto they are called; they are to redreſſe things
at preſent for which there is as yet no Law, and to provide future
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118248:7"/>
remedies for things amiſſe, which the Law did not foreſee.</p>
            <p>Now this is exceeding uſefull to the People, and neceſſary for
the People in ſuch caſes; but if this power ſhall be drawne out
into acts of Government; ſo far as it is ſo drawne out, the people
are governed arbitrarily by an Arbitrary power, which power
the people did put into their hands, not to make uſe of to this
end, but to enable them to prevent in any whatſoever.</p>
            <p>The power they are intruſted with, is an extraordinary power
for extraordinary ends and purpoſes, to which ſafely and ſwiftly
applyed, it will produce excellent effects; but if extended too far,
and to caſes for which it was not appointed nor is proper, it will
prove as great a miſcheife as it was hoped to be a remedy; for
the greateſt power being miſapplyed, having nothing to check
it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> muſt needs be the greateſt oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>A Parliament may far more eaſily err in Government, then a
King or ordinary Councel; for they have, or ſhould have their rule
to act by; but a Parliament act, by meere ſupremacy, by power
paramount, and from their determinations, there is no orderly
appeale: what they do but Vote is ſo, or ſhall be ſo, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the people are bound to ſtand to; therefore if they keep not
within a cleare circumference, within the bounds of cleare rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and juſtice, they do unadvoidably make the people ſlaves.
Remedies of this nature ſhould be very warily uſed, and very
carefully applyed to the diſeaſe; for as the advantage is great
in the right and skilfull application, ſo the danger is as great in
the miſapplication.</p>
            <p>Now ſince I have thus lighted upon ſo needfull a ſubject,
wherewith my mind hath been long full; both for mine owne
eaſe, and for publique benefit, I intend to vent my ſelfe a little
further about it.</p>
            <p>The ſafety of the People lies in government, for whoſe wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
it was erected.</p>
            <p>The ſafety of Government conſiſts much in the limits ſet unto
it, and the ſtrict obſervation of thoſe limits; which if it fall ſhort
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118248:7"/>
of, it is defective; and cannot attaine its end; if it exceed, it
proves burdenſome and Tyrannous.</p>
            <p>Take into conſideration what Government you will; if it
have not limits, or be not well bounded; thoſe who are under
it, muſt needs ſmart by it, and be entangled in thoſe miſeries
which Government is appointed to prevent.</p>
            <p>Now this is it I have much bewailed in mine owne thoughts
concerning Parliaments (whether juſtly or no; let the Reader
well conſider) that they are not well bounded, that the truſt
which is repoſed in them, is not clearly known, either by the
People, or perhaps by themſelves: but they are left unto, and
take unto themſelves ſo much ſcope, as it is very eaſie for them to
erre, almoſt impoſſible for them to act aright. Every man
that is to do any work, muſt throughly know his work, his rule
whereby he is to do it, and be carefull to eye the conformity of
the one with the other; if he know not his work, how can he ſet
about it at all? if he know not his rule, how can he ſet about
it a right? how apt will he be to ſlip into by-actions at leaſt?
and this great miſcheife accompanyes it too; he will be apt to
think he does every thing a right, and ſo to juſtifie himſelfe in the
moſt apparant injuſtice and oppreſſion, as the wit of man is very
ſubtle to do; for though he have a rule, he can bend the rule and
make it ſuit with his owne miſcarriages, how much more when
he thinks himſelfe left at liberty? It is ill truſting unbounded
Power any where; it is hard keeping Power upright, though
never ſo well bounded, but unbounded, it is a very ſharp toole,
and will quickly eat out all, but its owne Soveraignty.</p>
            <p>Man is very brutiſh in this reſpect, not ſearching into the root
and ground of things; but according to ſence, flying out upon
that which is moſt obious. If he find himſelfe oppreſſed, remove
but the hand that laid the burthen upon him, he preſently thinks
he is eaſed for ever; when alas poore foole, he finds by after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
that the ſucceeding finger is heavier then the foregoing
loyns. And how can this be otherwiſe? you muſt ſtill ſet up a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118248:8"/>
greater power to remove a leſſe, elſe it will not availe to do it;
and the greater it is, the weightier ſtrokes can it give, the
weightier burdens can it impoſe; and the more unlimited it is
the ſooner is it tempted ſo to doe; and the more unſuſpicious o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are of it, or it is of it ſelfe, the more likely is it to do it. So
that there is no truſting any man, or any ſort of men; they are
all of the ſame make, they have all the ſame principle to miſlead
them, the ſame by-ends and intereſts (the ſame at bottom, though
they appeare not the ſame) to work upon them, one as well as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother:
and though man, under the ſence of feare and danger,
may act warily and ſomewhat righteouſly; yet let thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles
be a little removed, you ſhall ſee what command ſelfe
hath over him; it hath the cheife command in his heart, and
will quickly appeare at his fingers ends: He that knowes not
this by himſelfe, knowes little of himſelfe; and he that knowes
this by himſelfe, and is not willing to be chained up (as a man
would chaine up a Lyon, or a Wolfe from doing harme) nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth
in himſelfe a deſire tp be a Tyrant: And people by
calling perſons to any office, putting them in any truſt, inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
them with any power in a dark confuſed way, without
cleare and diſtinct limitations, do ſow the ſeed-plors of Tiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
which by this meanes they too careleſly ſow, and may too
ſoon reap.</p>
            <p>And if the People of this Nation, have been too negligent of
their owne ſecurity in this reſpect; let ſuch as are able, and truly
love them, not take advantage hereof, but help them out of
the mire, by putting them into a way whereby they may do it
now, or by doing it to their hand ſo cleerly, ſo juſtly, as they
may not chuſe but owne it.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Yet further.</head>
               <p>There is great need of ſome fixed bounds and limits, to be a
ſquare or ſtandard to meaſure the actions of the Parliament by,
whereunto the People might have recourſe in matters of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,
between them and the Parliament, or in caſe of jealouſie
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118248:8"/>
that they were nor dealt faithfully with.</p>
               <p>It is a great truſt the people have committed to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
upon the faithfull diſcharge whereof their wellfare
doth much depend, by whoſe care they may be ſet into and
preſerved in a free and flouriſhing condition, by whoſe neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
or devotion, they may eaſily be impoveriſhed and
enſlaved.</p>
               <p>Now in equity, the people are not only allowed, but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveth
them in point of wiſdome, and by that duty of ſelfe-preſervation,
which nature teacheth all, to look after the
managing of this their truſt, to expect an account of it from
thoſe who are entruſted by them, to have full ſatisfaction that
it is managed with the beſt care, ſpeed, and fidelity to their
advantage.</p>
               <p>But how ſhall the People know this? how ſhall the
People be thus ſatisfied? is it not fit they ſhould be? If any
controverſie ariſe about it, that the people think or ſay they
are not well dealt with, their truſt is abuſed; Power not made
uſe of to preſerve them and their liberties, but to enſlave them;
that the Priviledges of Parliament ſwallow up their Rights
and Liberties, which they were ordained to defend.</p>
               <p>How ſhall this be decided? how ſhall it be truly and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known whether theſe things be ſo, or whether they be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
reproaches, unleſſe there were ſome ſtanding Priviledges
of reaſon or rules of Law extant, whereto any perſon doubting
might addreſſe himſelfe for ſatisfaction, and whereto their
actions ſhould ſo cleerly anſwer; that it ſhould not need any
great depth of reaſon to diſcerne the juſtneſſe, plainneſſe, and
integrity of them?</p>
               <p>And it might not be much out of the way to ſearch and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
whether this hath not been the bottome root of all our
diſturbances, the want of ſome cleere and ſetled Principles
for the Parliament to proceed by, or at leaſt the not divulging
and making common theſe Principles?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:118248:9"/>
The Parliament were at firſt looked upon with a loving aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
generally by the people: within a while the Kings party
falls of, conceiving his truſt and intereſt intrenched upon by
them, and ſtill calling for the diſcovery of thoſe priviledges and
fundamentall Lawes; which were pleaded in the behalfe of the
Parliament. Afterward the Parliament looſes more and
more, and growes too ſudainly to a very low ebbe in the eyes
of the people: and though occurrences help to raiſe it againe,
yet not to its former lovelineſſe; nor ſo, but that it ſinks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
againe, and its very freinds are often divided amongſt
themſelves. How can it be otherwiſe? how can men but
fall out, when occaſions of difference are continually ariſing, and
every man is left to his owne (perhaps misbyaſſed) reaſon and
judgement to determine, and has no cleare Rule before him,
to guid his eye and thoughts by?</p>
               <p>This made the caſe between the late King and them, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more difficult, then ſome have thought. He had a truſt
committed to him, ſo had they alſo: but the bounds of either
were not fully cleared, and ſo they claſhed (as powers are very
apt to do) and in their claſhing, their charge againſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was one and the ſame. They charged him with viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Lawes, with extending his prerogatives to the hurt of
the people, with ruling according to will, &amp;c. He likewiſe
charged them with overturning the Lawes, with aſſuming pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
prejudiciall both to him and the People, with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into an Arbitrary government. So theſe two great
Powers fall out, having no ſtandard to determine theſe things
by, whereby it might appeare which were truly guilty, but
each juſtifie themſelves and condemne the other, according to
the ordinary courſe of man, who is very ſenſible of the injuries
he receives but very inſenſible of thoſe hee does: Nor had the
people any ſtandard neither, and ſo they fell in with either, as
their minds lead them, to the ruining &amp; deſtroying of one ano<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther.
Now the ſame caſe may hapen between the people &amp; the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118248:9"/>
Parliament, as hath done between the Parliament and the
late King. The people may vote it in their thoughts and
minds, that the Parliament do not diſcharge their truſt,
that they meddle with that which the people hath not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
them with, neglect the doing of that which the
people have entrvſted them to do, that they elevate their
priviledges, not in circumſtances, but in ſubſtantiall things,
to the prejudice of the people. The Parliament on the
contrary, may contend, that they have been faithfull, have
run great hazards, through their love and faithfullneſſe to
the people, have denyed themſelves more then ever any
Parliament hath done, that the people owe them a better
requitall, and ought to allow them power and priviledges
anſwerable to the work they employ them about, which
in equity would ariſe far higher then any they make uſe of.
How may this be fairly endod? what ſhall be done in this
caſe? is there no way of determining this, but by ſtrength
and power? ſhall the people make uſe of their power
(taking their accuſation for granted) and ruſh upon the,
Parliament to ſeek its deſtruction? or ſhall the Parliament
(being cleare in their owne eyes, and looked upon with
an evill eye by the people) make uſe of an Army to ſtop
the peoples mouths, that they may not dare to mutter any
thing againſt them? were it not better, that ſome cleare
Principles of Reaſon, whereby Parliaments were firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
might be produced and brought to light, both to ſquare
their actions by, and to ſquare mens judgements in the
conſideration of their actions.</p>
               <p>So that this might be uſefull, both in reſpect of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
and people; for want whereof, the Parliament
may have been drawne to do many things, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
they would not have done, if they had cleerly ſeene,
they had not been entruſted with them: and the people
may have been enſnared to entertaine and reteine hard
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118248:10"/>
thoughts of the Parliament about actions which were regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <hi>by</hi>
undertaken and faithfully managed for the peace and ſafety
of the people.</p>
               <p>Vpon theſe and ſuch like conſiderations, I cannot but wiſh
that ſome ſuch thing might be ſpeedily and effectually done,
with equall reſpect both to the people on the one hand, whoſe
ſafety and proſperity is mainly to be minded and to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamen-on
the other hand, who are ſo far to be honoured and
furniſhed with power and priviledges, as they may beſt effect
and not deviate from the good and proſperity of the people.
In order whereunto I am conſtrained to propound and deſire
theſe three enſuing particulars.</p>
               <p>1. That a true meaſure of the Parliaments truſt from
clear Principles of Reaſon or Law, or both, may be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
to open view; whereby every Parliament-man may
ſee what he is to do, what not; and whereby any of the
people may ſee what they are to expect, what not: and
theſe not to be wreſted in favour to any party, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the ſtate and nature of the thing it ſelf. This might
be a foundation of peace and ſecurity between them and the
People, whereas now they lye under a double blame, both
of not having don that they were entruſted to performe and
of having ſet about that they were not entruſted with: the
foundation of this controverſy between them and the people
is deeply laid, however it is ſuppreſſed at preſent from
breaking forth.</p>
               <p>2 That in the mean time till this can be done, there may
be free liberty given to any ſort of men (whoſe ſpirits are
ſenſible of fundamentall dangers, are ready to improve
their utmoſt abilities for publique good) to diſcover any
ſubſtantiall matters amiſſe in the preſent proceedings, and
that a ſelect Committee may be appointed at certain times
to heare and conſider thereof, in ſuch a way as the perſons
who ſhall offer their ſervice herein, may not be tired out
with ſeeking up and down after them, which is a thing
much complained of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:118248:10"/>
And I cannot ſay leſſe of it then that it is a very unkind and
injurious dealing with the people, which I ſhould be glad to
ſee regularly amended, for I look upon that kind of amending
only as laſting. And if the Parliament would pleaſe to think
of rectifying things diſorderly among themſelves, by a righteous
rule preſcribed unto themſelves (which is the way of rectifying
things amiſſe in the great body of the Common-weale, and why
ſhould it not be alſo in the leſſe) they might perhaps act farre
more ſpeedily and ſafely, then otherwiſe it is poſſible for
them to do.</p>
               <p>3. Thas there may be ſome way thought of, how the work
of Parliaments may be diſpatched with more ſpeed, and
thigns left in an ordinary way of government, that the people
may not any longer be frighted with the long continuance of
an extraordinary power. Surely Nature doth not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
ends, and ſuit means to them, but doth wiſely order
direct, and guid the means unto the end, which if there be a
neglect in, the dictate of nature is not underſtood, or not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
unto. Nature will not appoint a Parliament to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
againſt greevances, oppreſſions, &amp;c. &amp; preſcribe them to
act in ſuch a way, as the work muſt neceſſarily grow faster
upon them, then it can be diſpatched by them.</p>
               <p>This is all I intend to expreſſe at preſent, only I ſhould
intreat thoſe, who now ſit at ſterne, to be wonderous
watchfull over themſelves, and wary about the managing
of affairs, for there is a very ſevere eye upon them. It is not
for nothing that ſo great ones have been throwne downe
before them, and they exalted ſo high, the ſtep is not ſo
vaſt between the people and them, as was betweene them
and their Predeceſſors. All the power they have is from
the people, and for the people: if they have blamed others
for unfaithfullneſſe (and have ſeene as they ſay the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God follow it) let them take heed of being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull
themſelves, if they aſſume more power or privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
then is committed to them, and allowed them, if they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118248:11"/>
do any other worke then what they are entruſted with, they
cannot excuſe themſelves of unfaithfulneſſe: if they throwe
downe one government becauſe of arbitrarineſſe (for that
was the originall quarrell) and ſettle another in an arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
way, this is not only unfaithfulneſſe, but injuſtce. Oh
when ſhall this poor oppreſſed enthralled people be made
free! When ſhall the true foundations of freedome and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
be laid! Oh conſider what opportunities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
yee uow have above any that ever went before
you. Do your worke throughly, go to the bottome: let not
the intereſt of any ſort of men divert you from minding of
the good and welfare of the people, whom yee are ſingly to
eye, and not particular perſons or intereſts. If I could ſpeak
as I would, I ſhould ſpeake more, not onely for the peoples
ſake, but alſo for yours, who ſtand on ſo ticle a point, either
to be inſtruments of woe or welfare, and are very likely to
meet with either large bleſſings, or a ſwift and ſharp viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
